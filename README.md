#TitoTwito
It is a bot for twitter coded on **Javascript** that earn followers following different strategies.

At first you will need an account for earning followers and other account that will RT some tweet.

For coding it I have used [twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit) library, which I recommend for making projects on twitter.

#Installing
```
npm install 
```

Set your tokens on **requires/Config.js**:

```javascript
stream.on('user_event', function (eventMsg) {
  //...
})
```
